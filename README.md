# CPP-Financial-Maths-Exercises
My solutions to the exercises in Armstrong's C++ for Financial Mathematics. Will be continuously updated as I solve the later chapters.
All work here is my own. Armstrong offers a full set of solutions on his website. However, all my work has been written and elaborated without consulting anything other than the book's contents.
