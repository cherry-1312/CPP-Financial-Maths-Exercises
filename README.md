# CPP-Financial-Maths-Exercises
My solutions to the exercises in Armstrong's C++ for Financial Mathematics. Will be continuously updated as I solve the later chapters.
All work here is my own. Armstrong offers a full set of solutions on his website. However, all my work has been written and elaborated without consulting anything other than the book's contents.

Chapter 7 contains the biggest bulk of work so far. I applied the central limit theorem to generate a normal distribution of random values with mean 0 and std 1 and then created a snippet of code to plot said values into a neat histogram. The html for this histogram can be found in the folder HTML Examples under the name
histogram_test.html .
